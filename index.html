      Turkish March etc.

        A real musician is not the one who plays what his audience wants to
        hear, but plays what he wants his audience to hear.

      <h2>My Experiences with The Great Music Pieces of Mozart.</h2>
      <p>
        As a child, I grew up listening to Indian Bollywood, but when I was into
        my late teenage years, I got a recommendation on youtube about Mozart
        Music. This happened because I started learning guitar from youtube and
        the algorithm recommends it to me. I was a love at first hearing. I
        started hearing his music like a dedicated fan. His music was not like
        some emotional death scene or some love-breakup or billionare success
        movie, but it reminds and unfolds some very beautiful and very dark
        aspects of life. It makes me cry, smile, fearfull, confident, angry,
        suspicious and sometimes it makes me completely numb.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna">Vienna</a> where he
        achieved fame but little financial security. During his final years in
        Vienna, he composed many of his best-known symphonies, concertos and
        operas and portions of the Requiem, which was largely unfinished at the
        time of his early death at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death
        have been much mytholized.
